# BrassTax
Repository for CS360 semester project. Contains code for the project and gives version control across all our systems. Meant to increase stability so that if somebody has a system failure it doesn't wreck all other project members.

## Guidelines 
1. Main branch should contain ***deployable code only***. Fork for personal work and adding features
2. Don't commit dependencies or at least tell everybody asap and don't do it on the main branch without warning.
3. Don't use passwords or stuff that will lock people out of stuff. Not cool.
4. See this [link](https://dev.to/datreeio/top-10-github-best-practices-3kl2)
